# Questions

Questions asked in class that we need to learn more about, or maybe that we want to remember.

## Assignments
* Where was the example design document?
  * It is in the relations example, [here](https://github.com/MRU-COMP1502-201901/COMP-1502-001-W19/blob/master/examples/relations/vending_design.md).

## Java
* What's all this about enums?
   * Now added as a repl.it for this week, with notes on blackboard. Examples to come very shortly.
* What was that 2D ArrayList thing?
   * We will revisit that in a couple of weeks.
* What about static stuff?
   * A topic we'll talk about soon.

## Git
* How do we delete git if we need to?
   * Git adds a hidden directory (on \*nix machines) called .git. Deleting that directory removes git and all version control from your directory.
* How do we avoid the awful menace of vim when committing on the command line?
   * [Change your editor.](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/)
* How do I make GitHub make with the pretty on my markdown documents?
   * GitHub will automatically process any file that ends in .md as a markdown file. If your file is showing raw text, check the extension. You can edit any markdown file in the web editor (find the pencil button to the right), or in your perfered text editor.

## repl.it
* Is it possible to restart a replit once we've started one?

## Installing Eclipse and Java
* How do we install Java and Eclipse on a Windows Machine? (Also Mac?)

## Environments
* How do we configure a prompt on bash?
