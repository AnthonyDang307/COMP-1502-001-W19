# Questions

Questions asked in class that we need to learn more about, or maybe that we want to remember.

## Java
* What's all this about enums?
   * Now added as a repl.it for this week, with notes on blackboard.
* What was that 2D ArrayList thing?
   * We will revisit that in a couple of weeks.
* What about static stuff?
   * A topic we'll talk about soon.

## Git
* How do we delete git if we need to?
   * Git adds a hidden directory (on \*nix machines) called .git. Deleting that directory removes git and all version control from your directory.
* How do we avoid the awful menace of vim when committing on the command line?
   * [Change your editor.](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/)

## repl.it
* Is it possible to restart a replit once we've started one?

## Installing Eclipse and Java
* How do we install Java and Eclipse on a Windows Machine? (Also Mac?)

## Environments
* How do we configure a prompt on bash?
