# Using GitHub and Eclipse

This [tutorial](https://github.com/collab-uniba/socialcde4eclipse/wiki/How-to-import-a-GitHub-project-into-Eclipse) was actually helpful. It's not the same as our eclipse, but it's closer than most other tutorials.

## Setting up Eclipse with a Repository

1. In Eclipse, go to `Window` -> `Show View` -> `Other` and go down the list that pops up until you find `Git`. Click on Git to open it and select the view `Git Repositories`. A window labeled `Git Repositories` should pop up in your view (bottom left?).
1. In the `Git Repositories` window click on the link `Clone repository`
   1. This will bring up a window which asks you to give the remote information, where it asked for the uri. Paste in the link you get when you press the green "Clone or Download" button on your repository main page.
